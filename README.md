# COMP4521 project : PetReunion

## Background Information

Each year, around 10 million pets are lost in the US and only 15 percent of dogs and 2
percent of cats are reunited with their owners. Loss of pets may trigger detrimental mental
health issues to pet owners, especially harming the growth and development of children.

There are some lost pet listing apps launched in the market. Unfortunately, due to the
non-intuitive design, most of the applications are not efficient or effective. As a result, pet
owners end up overwhelmed and frustrated.

To solve this tragedy, we would like to develop an app PetReunion to help lost pets reunite
with their beloved owners. The main feature of the app utilizes the connections between pet
owners and pet finders and social media sharing, which provides an efficient solution for pet
owners to trace their missing pets.
